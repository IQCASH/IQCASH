Mandatory Update
==============

IQCash Core v2.0.0 is a mandatory update for all users. This release contains various updates/fixes pertaining to the ICS protocol, supply tracking, block transmission and relaying, as well as usability and quality-of-life updates to the GUI.

Users will have a grace period to update their clients before versions prior to this release are no longer allowed to connect to this (and future) version(s).


How to Upgrade
==============

If you are running an older version, shut it down. Wait until it has completely shut down (which might take a few minutes for older versions), then run the installer (on Windows) or just copy over /Applications/IQCash-Qt (on Mac) or iqcashd/iqcash-qt (on Linux).


Compatibility
==============

IQCash Core is extensively tested on multiple operating systems using
the Linux kernel, macOS 10.8+, and Windows Vista and later.

Microsoft ended support for Windows XP on [April 8th, 2014](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/WindowsForBusiness/end-of-xp-support),
No attempt is made to prevent installing or running the software on Windows XP, you
can still do so at your own risk but be aware that there are known instabilities and issues.
Please do not report issues about Windows XP to the issue tracker.

IQCash Core should also work on most other Unix-like systems but is not
frequently tested on them.
